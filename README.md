# dynamic-weather-dashboard

## Description
This is an application which allows the user to type a city into an input box, submit with a click of the button and a dashboard will show up displaying the weather for that city as well as a 5 day forecast. The selected city will be saved in the search history so that the user can refer back to the city without having to type it again.
