# dynamic-weather-dashboard

## Description
This is an application which allows the user to type a city into an input box, submit with a click of the button and a dashboard will show up displaying the weather for that city as well as a 5 day forecast. The selected city will be saved in the search history so that the user can refer back to the city without having to type it again.

I did not have enough time to finish the project so this is what I have. The user can type a city into the search box and submit at which time the weather for that city will populate underneath the H2. There is not a 5 day forecast and there is no styling. I wish I had more time but I had this trip planned long before I was even considering this bootcamp.
